  <h2>Mindset</h2>
  <h3> Step 1 : Selfless </h3>
  <p>
    In general , Wide receivers are regarded as "Divas" who only care about getting the ball passed to them. I believe that in order to be successful from a team standpoint and individually, you have to be extremely selfless. As explained on the<a href="history.html">history</a>page, receiver is so much more than catching the ball and the great ones understand this.
</p>
<h3> Step 2 : Success Leaves Clues </h3>
<p>
  Jerry Rice once said , "Today i will do what others wont, so tomrrow i can accomplish what others can't" while this quote can apply in many areas of life for a young wide receiver i believe it's important to understand that this position is extremely competitive so in order to be successful you have to be willing to wokr harder, longer and more efficient than anyone else. As Rice explained, many athletes will have the natural ability to play the position but the great ones accomplish amazing feats because they go the extra mile. Studying these quotes and players in general i also believe is important because success leaves clues. If these guys have accomplished everything that i want to, why deviate from their blueprint?
</p>
<h3> Step 3 : Application </h3>
<p>
  While it's great to have knowledge of the game, know the great players, know what they did none of this matters if you dont apply these tools to your game. Many athletes get complacent or lazy and that is what creates the seperation of average receievers to the great one. The <a href="fundamentals">fundamentals</a>page gives some physical type to improve but it's imperitive to apply all of these steps to be successful.
