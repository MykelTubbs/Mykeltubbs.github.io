        <h1>Mykel Tubbs</h1>
        <h2> Early Life </h2>
        <p>
        I was born November 19, 1999 in Fayettville North Carolina.
         Born into a military family , I was forced to move around as a child.
         My mother and I moved to Rhode Island for a few years before finally moving to my permanant home of Atlanta, Georgia.
         My immediate family is small, but I do have a little sister named Willow and a dog named Taz.
       </p>
       <p>
         I started playing football at the age of 8 and haven't looked back since.
         My family immediately knew I possessed a gift to play the sport and ensured I went to various football camps.
         This process would continue until I reached highschool and continued to excel.
        </p>
        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>
          I had the opportunity to attend one of the prestigious highschool's in Georgia and excelled.
          In my freshman year I quickly made a presence on and off of the football field.
          I started on varsity and made my name known around the state getting interest from many major D1 colleges.
          After a great freshman year, all the major schools had me on their radar but unfortunately I tore my ACL and missed alot of time.
        </p>
        <h3>Triumph</h3>
        <p>
          While it was devasting to sustain an injury like that, I didn't allow it to stop me.
          Unfortunately many of the major D1 schools backed off, but i stil was able to get back healthy and earn 15 D1 scholarships.
          I eventually signed with the Air Force Academy and played for them for a year before transferring to the University Of Miami.
