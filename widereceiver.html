        <h2>Welcome To The Wide Receiver Bible</h2>

        <p>
      This page will serve as a guide to young Wide Receivers country-wide. My goal is to give blue print on how to be successful at this position while playing the game that we love. While this game may be simple, understanding the wide receiver position is much more than just catching the ball and running. The mental strain along with the physical strain is what makes this position so special. This page will give a glimpse of what those psychological and physical strains are.
