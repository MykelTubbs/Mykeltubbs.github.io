        <h3> Catching </h3>
        <p>
          As a receiver one of your most important attributes is your hands but the first step into becoming a consistent catcher is discipline with your eyes! Your eyes have to be able to locate the tip of the football until you tuck the ball. Eye discipline is more than important because most drops that you see occur because the receiver took his eyes off of the ball.

        </p>
        <h3> Running Routes </h3>
        <p>
          Many of the great receivers will tell you that in order to become a great route runner , you have to run routes. Now, this seems simple but many young receivers will get caught up in the fancy foot work drills that you see on social media and while these drills look pleasing to the eye and your footwork may improve , the best way to become a great route runner and to practice running the actual routes!
        </p>
        <h3> Deception </h3>
        <p>
          The last of the basic fundamentals of being a receiver is to be as deceiving as possible. Meaning the defender shouldnt be able to tell what you will do next. To achieve this you have to work on being sudden, when doing certain drills drastically change the pace in which you make moves and continue to do this until it becomes natural.
